# coding-events-4
The purpose of the app:
An app to view and add coding Events available to attend with the option to add your own categories and events.

The current state of the app
The app currently accepts user input for events and categories, as well as listing the events, and deleting events.

future improvements
Create a form to delete a category, add a Person class to save users with the user info, events they want to attend, events they are
attending, events they have created, and a class where a person can join to be included with other users in a specific organization
(an employer, school, etc.). This way an event can be added to that organization if it would be of high interest to the users 
included in that org.
